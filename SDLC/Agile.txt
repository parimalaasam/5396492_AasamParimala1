I have successfully completed the “Agile for Beginners” course offered by Great Learning,
a certificate‑based introductory program designed to provide a solid foundation in Agile methodology and software development life cycles (SDLC). 
The curriculum included a comparison between Waterfall and Agile approaches, core Agile principles, iterative development practices, and effective team collaboration techniques.
This course helped me develop the mindset and essential knowledge to contribute effectively in Agile-oriented environments.
